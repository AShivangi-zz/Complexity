Conclusion: 
The algorithms have almost the same outputs (with a difference of 0.0001) which can be concluded from the JUnit tests. In all the above cases, 
the regular multiplication is faster than strassen's multiplication as in strassen's algorithm, the constant is significantly large and 
hence effects the running time. Asymptotically, strassen's algorithm is faster than regular multiplication but due to small sizes of the 
matrices, solving sub-matrices in strassen's costs more time than regular multiplication.
